# EVidential-Inference-Learning

## Introduction
This repository is for our ISBI 2023 paper '[EVIL: Evidential Inference Learning for Trustworthy Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10230589/)'

## Dataset
### ACDC
Download the processed ACDC data from [BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1d0cFhj3LU029oHajNni8KQ), the password is *code*, and decompress the zip file to [data/ACDC](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/SSL4MIS/edit/master/data/ACDC).

## Usage
### Train
run train_EVIL_acdc.py
### Test
run test_2D_acdc.py

## Checkpoint
The trained model and .log file are put under the path 'model/'. You can download and test the results.
